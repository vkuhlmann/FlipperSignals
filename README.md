# FlipperSignals

This was a mini one-day project where two devices were investigated:
- The Sub-Ghz signal of the remote for the Bubendorff blinds (based on images online seems to be B226001).
- The infrared signals of the remote for the Fujitsu AR-REB1E airconditioning.

The signal was captured by a Flipper device, and superficially analyzed in Python.

The repository and code is not documented, and is not intended for investigating other devices
or explaining the signal emitted by the remote control by these devices.

This repository may still be useful for people searching a starting point for investigating the signal of one of these two devices.
